      "Text: Darth Vader, also known by his birth name Anakin Skywalker, is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise.123 Vader appears in the original film trilogy as a pivotal antagonist whose actions drive the plot, while his past as Anakin Skywalker and the story of his corruption are central to the narrative of the prequel trilogy., The character was created by George Lucas and has been portrayed by numerous actors. His appearances span the first six Star Wars films, as well as Rogue One, and his character is heavily referenced in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. He is also an important character in the Star Wars expanded universe of television series, video games, novels, literature and comic books. Originally a Jedi prophesied to bring balance to the Force, he falls to the dark side of the Force and serves the evil Galactic Empire at the right hand of his Sith master, Emperor Palpatine (also known as Darth Sidious).4 He is also the father of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa, secret husband of Padmé Amidala and grandfather of Kylo Ren., Darth Vader has become one of the most iconic villains in popular culture, and has been listed among the greatest villains and fictional characters ever.56 The American Film Institute listed him as the third greatest movie villain in cinema history on 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, behind Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates.7 However, other critics consider him a tragic hero, citing his original motivations for the greater good before his fall to the dark side..\n",

A naturally skilled warrior, he was eventually chosen to serve as the genetic template for the Clone Army of the Galactic Republic. These clone soldiers were genetically modified to be predisposed toward unquestioning obedience to the chain of command, unlike their highly independent progenitor. Jango was also the \"father\" of unaltered clone Boba Fett, which he requested as part of his contract with the Kaminoans.\n",

It first appeared onscreen in the 1997 Special Edition of Return of the Jedi, but was first mentioned in Timothy Zahns 1991 novel Heir to the Empire. A city occupying an entire planet, it was renamed Imperial Center during the reign of the Galactic Empire (as depicted in the original films) and Yuuzhantar during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion (as depicted in the New Jedi Order novel series). The demonym and adjective form of the planet name is Coruscanti.\", \"Coruscant is, at various times, the capital of the Old Republic, the Galactic Empire, the New Republic, the Yuuzhan Vong Empire and the Galactic Alliance. Not only is Coruscant central to all these governing bodies, it is the navigational center of the galaxy, given that its hyperspace coordinates are (0,0,0). Due to its location and large population, roughly 2 trillion sentients, the galaxys main trade routes — Perlemian Trade Route, Hydian Way, Corellian Run and Corellian Trade Spine — go through Coruscant, making it the richest and most influential world in the Star Wars galaxy. Coruscant is the sixth planet out of 11 planets in the Coruscant solar system, and has four moons; Centax-1, Centax-2, Centax-3, and Hesperidium.\", The Galactic Standard Calendar was the standard measurement of time in the Star Wars galaxy. It centered on the Coruscant tropical year. The Coruscant solar cycle was 368 days long; with a day consisting of 360 NET degrees (or 24 standard hours).3 Numerous epochs were used to determine calendar eras. The most recent of these calendar eras used the Battle of Yavin (i.e. the destruction of the first Death Star) as its epoch, or \"year zero\": BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin), and ABY (After the Battle of Yavin).4 The earliest date in the Star Wars expanded universe as a whole is 13,000,000,000 BBY, which serves as the year the universe was created.\n",

The character was originally conceived as male before being changed to female.

The screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas was from a story by Lucas, who was also the executive producer. It is the third installment in the original Star Wars trilogy and the first film to use THX technology. The film is set one year after The Empire Strikes Back9 and was produced by Howard Kazanjian for Lucasfilm Ltd. The film stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew and Frank Oz., \"The Galactic Empire, under the direction of the ruthless Emperor, is constructing a second Death Star in order to crush the Rebel Alliance once and for all. Since the Emperor plans to personally oversee the final stages of its construction, the Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack on the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill the Emperor, effectively bringing an end to the Empires hold over the galaxy. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker, a Jedi apprentice, struggles to bring his father Darth Vader back to the Light Side of the Force.\", \"David Lynch and David Cronenberg were considered to direct the project before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjians schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow Industrial Light & Magic more time to work on the films effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to May\\xa01982\\xa0(1982-05). Strict secrecy surrounded the production and the film used the working title Blue Harvest to prevent price gouging.\", \"The film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983, six years to the day after the release of the first film, receiving mostly positive reviews. The film grossed between $475 million67 and $572 million worldwide.8 Several home video and theatrical releases and revisions to the film followed over the next 20 years. Star Wars continued with The Phantom Menace as part of the film series prequel trilogy.\", A sequel, The Force Awakens, was released on December 18, 2015, as part of the new sequel trilogy.10\n",

Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay, with George Lucas writing the films story and serving as executive producer. The second installment in the original Star Wars trilogy, it was produced by Gary Kurtz for Lucasfilm and stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz.\", \"The film is set three years after Star Wars. The Galactic Empire, under the leadership of the villainous Darth Vader and the Emperor, is in pursuit of Luke Skywalker and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. While Vader relentlessly pursues the small band of Lukes friends—Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, and others—across the galaxy, Luke studies the Force under Jedi Master Yoda. When Vader captures Lukes friends, Luke must decide whether to complete his training and become a full Jedi Knight or to confront Vader and save them.\", \"Following a difficult production, The Empire Strikes Back was released on May 21, 1980. It received mixed reviews from critics initially but has since grown in esteem, becoming the most critically acclaimed chapter in the Star Wars saga; it is now widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.5678 The film ranks #3 on Empires 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.9 It became the highest-grossing film of 1980 and, to date, has earned more than $538\\xa0million worldwide from its original run and several re-releases. When adjusted for inflation, it is the second-highest-grossing sequel of all time and the 13th-highest-grossing film in North America.10 The film was followed by Return of the Jedi, which was released in 1983.\", In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States\\ National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"\n",

      "https://swapi.co/resource/film/5 -> https://swapi.co/vocabulary/desc -> Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones is a 2002 American epic space opera film directed by George Lucas and written by Lucas and Jonathan Hales. It is the second installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, and stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Temuera Morrison, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Frank Oz., \"Set ten years after the events in The Phantom Menace, the galaxy is on the brink of civil war. Led by a former Jedi named Count Dooku, thousands of planetary systems threaten to secede from the Galactic Republic. After Senator Padmé Amidala evades assassination, Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker becomes her protector, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi investigates the attempt on Padmés life. Soon Anakin, Padmé and Obi-Wan witness the onset of a new threat to the galaxy, the Clone Wars.\", Development of Attack of the Clones began in March 2000, after the release of The Phantom Menace. By June 2000, Lucas and Hales completed a draft of the script and principal photography took place from June to September 2000. The film crew primarily shot at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, Australia, with additional footage filmed in Tunisia, Spain and Italy. It was one of the first motion pictures shot completely on a high-definition digital 24-frame system., \"The film was released in the United States on May 16, 2002. Some critics hailed it as an improvement over The Phantom Menace, while others called it the worst entry of the franchise.56 The visual effects, costume design, musical score, action scenes and Ewan McGregor’s performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi were all praised, however the romance of Anakin and Padmé, the dialogue and the films long runtime were all criticized. The film was a financial success, making over $649 million worldwide; however, it also became the first Star Wars film to be outgrossed in its year of release, placing third domestically and fourth internationally. The film was released on VHS and DVD on November 12, 2002 and was later released on Blu-ray on September 16, 2011. Following Attack of the Clones, the third and final film of the prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith, premiered in 2005.\"\n",

Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith introduced earlier models of walkers, such as the AT-TE, and the Star Wars expanded universe features numerous others.

      "https://swapi.co/resource/film/6 -> https://swapi.co/vocabulary/desc -> Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith is a 2005 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas. It is the sixth entry of the Star Wars film series and stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Frank Oz. A sequel to The Phantom Menace (1999) and Attack of the Clones (2002), the film is the third and final installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy., The film begins three years after the onset of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights are spread across the galaxy, leading a massive war against the Separatists. The Jedi Council dispatches Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to eliminate the notorious General Grievous, leader of the Separatist Army. Meanwhile, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker grows close to Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and, unknown to the public, a Sith Lord. Their deepening friendship threatens the Jedi Order, the Republic, and Anakin himself., \"Lucas began writing the script before production of Attack of the Clones ended. Production of Revenge of the Sith started in September 2003, and filming took place in Australia with additional locations in Thailand, Switzerland, China, Italy and the United Kingdom. Revenge of the Sith premiered on May 15, 2005, at the Cannes Film Festival, then released worldwide on May 19, 2005. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, especially in contrast to the less positive reviews of the previous two prequels, including praise for its storyline, action scenes, John Williams musical score, visual effects, and performances from Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, Frank Oz, and Jimmy Smits. It is the final film in the Star Wars franchise to be distributed by 20th Century Fox before The Walt Disney Companys acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012.\", Revenge of the Sith broke several box office records during its opening week and went on to earn over $848 million worldwide,4 making it, at the time, the third-highest-grossing film in the Star Wars franchise, unadjusted for inflation. It was the highest-grossing film of 2005 in the U.S. and the second-highest-grossing film of 2005 behind Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.4 The film also holds the record for the highest opening day gross on a Thursday, making $50,013,859.00.5 The Star Wars saga continued with the release of The Force Awakens, the first installment of the sequel trilogy, in 2015.67\n",

      "https://swapi.co/resource/film/6 -> https://swapi.co/vocabulary/altDesc -> Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith is a 2005 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas. It is the sixth entry of the Star Wars film series and stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Frank Oz. A sequel to The Phantom Menace (1999) and Attack of the Clones (2002), the film is the third and final installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy., The film begins three years after the onset of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights are spread across the galaxy, leading a massive war against the Separatists. The Jedi Council dispatches Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to eliminate the notorious General Grievous, leader of the Separatist Army. Meanwhile, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker grows close to Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and, unknown to the public, a Sith Lord. Their deepening friendship threatens the Jedi Order, the Republic, and Anakin himself., \"Lucas began writing the script before production of Attack of the Clones ended. Production of Revenge of the Sith started in September 2003, and filming took place in Australia with additional locations in Thailand, Switzerland, China, Italy and the United Kingdom. Revenge of the Sith premiered on May 15, 2005, at the Cannes Film Festival, then released worldwide on May 19, 2005. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, especially in contrast to the less positive reviews of the previous two prequels, including praise for its storyline, action scenes, John Williams musical score, visual effects, and performances from Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, Frank Oz, and Jimmy Smits. It is the final film in the Star Wars franchise to be distributed by 20th Century Fox before The Walt Disney Companys acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012.\", Revenge of the Sith broke several box office records during its opening week and went on to earn over $848 million worldwide,4 making it, at the time, the third-highest-grossing film in the Star Wars franchise, unadjusted for inflation. It was the highest-grossing film of 2005 in the U.S. and the second-highest-grossing film of 2005 behind Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.4 The film also holds the record for the highest opening day gross on a Thursday, making $50,013,859.00.5 The Star Wars saga continued with the release of The Force Awakens, the first installment of the sequel trilogy, in 2015.67\n",

It is the second installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, and stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Temuera Morrison, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Frank Oz., \"Set ten years after the events in The Phantom Menace, the galaxy is on the brink of civil war. Led by a former Jedi named Count Dooku, thousands of planetary systems threaten to secede from the Galactic Republic. After Senator Padmé Amidala evades assassination, Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker becomes her protector, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi investigates the attempt on Padmés life. Soon Anakin, Padmé and Obi-Wan witness the onset of a new threat to the galaxy, the Clone Wars.\", Development of Attack of the Clones began in March 2000, after the release of The Phantom Menace. By June 2000, Lucas and Hales completed a draft of the script and principal photography took place from June to September 2000. The film crew primarily shot at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, Australia, with additional footage filmed in Tunisia, Spain and Italy. It was one of the first motion pictures shot completely on a high-definition digital 24-frame system., \"The film was released in the United States on May 16, 2002. Some critics hailed it as an improvement over The Phantom Menace, while others called it the worst entry of the franchise.56 The visual effects, costume design, musical score, action scenes and Ewan McGregor’s performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi were all praised, however the romance of Anakin and Padmé, the dialogue and the films long runtime were all criticized. The film was a financial success, making over $649 million worldwide; however, it also became the first Star Wars film to be outgrossed in its year of release, placing third domestically and fourth internationally. The film was released on VHS and DVD on November 12, 2002 and was later released on Blu-ray on September 16, 2011. Following Attack of the Clones, the third and final film of the prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith, premiered in 2005.\"\n",

Throughout the course of the films, he joins or supports Padmé Amidala, Anakin Skywalker, Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi in various points in the saga., \"English actor Kenny Baker played R2-D2 in all three original Star Wars films, and received billing credit for the character in the prequel trilogy, where Bakers role was reduced, as R2-D2 was portrayed mainly by radio controlled props and CGI models. In the sequel trilogy, Baker was credited as consultant for The Force Awakens, however Jimmy Vee also co-performed the character in some scenes. Vee later took over the role beginning in The Last Jedi.1 R2-D2s sounds and vocal effects were created by Ben Burtt.

Built by Anakin Skywalker, C-3PO was designed as a protocol droid intended to assist in etiquette, customs, and translation, boasting that he is \"fluent in over six million forms of communication\". Along with his astromech droid counterpart and friend R2-D2, C-3PO provides comic relief within the narrative structure of the films, and serves as a foil. Anthony Daniels has portrayed the character in all nine Star Wars cinematic films released to date, including Rogue One and the animated The Clone Wars; C-3PO and R2-D2 are the only characters to appear in every film., \"Despite his oblivious nature, C-3PO has played a pivotal role in the Galaxys history, appearing under the service of Shmi Skywalker, the Lars homestead, Padmé Amidala, Raymus Antilles, Luke Skywalker, and Leia Organa. In the majority of depictions, C-3POs physical appearance is primarily a polished gold plating, although his appearance varies throughout the films; including the absence of metal coverings in The Phantom Menace, a dull copper plating in Attack of the Clones, a silver lower right leg introduced in A New Hope, and a red left arm in The Force Awakens.1 C-3PO also appears frequently in the Star Wars Canon and Star Wars Legends continuities of novels, comic books, and video games, and was the protagonist in the ABC television show Droids.\"\n",

In the original trilogy, he is depicted as the aged, pale-faced and cloaked Emperor of the Galactic Empire and the master of Darth Vader. In the prequel trilogy, he is portrayed as a charismatic Senator from Naboo who uses deception and political manipulation to rise to the position of Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, and then reorganizes the Republic into the Galactic Empire, with himself as Emperor., \"Though outwardly appearing to be a well-intentioned public servant and supporter of democracy prior to becoming Emperor,5 he is actually Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith – a cult of practitioners of the dark side of the Force previously thought to have been extinct in the Star Wars galaxy for a millennium.5 As Sidious, he instigates the Clone Wars, nearly destroys the Jedi, and transforms the Republic into the Empire. He also manipulates Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into turning to the dark side and serving at his side as Darth Vader. Palpatines reign is brought to an end when Vader kills him to save his son, Luke Skywalker.\", Since the initial theatrical run of Return of the Jedi, Palpatine has become a widely recognized popular culture symbol of evil, sinister deception, dictatorship, tyranny, and the subversion of democracy.\n",

      "https://swapi.co/vocabulary/Human -> https://swapi.co/vocabulary/desc -> Modern humans (Homo sapiens, primarily ssp. Homo sapiens sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina, a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.34, Early hominins—particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes—are less often referred to as \"human\" than hominins of the genus Homo.5 Several of these hominins used fire, occupied much of Eurasia, and gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 200,000 years ago.67 They began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago. In several waves of migration, anatomically modern humans ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world.8, The spread of humans and their large and increasing population has had a profound impact on large areas of the environment and millions of native species worldwide. Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, which enable high levels of abstract reasoning, language, problem solving, sociality, and culture through social learning. Humans use tools to a much higher degree than any other animal, are the only extant species known to build fires and cook their food, and are the only extant species to clothe themselves and create and use numerous other technologies and arts., Humans are uniquely adept at using systems of symbolic communication (such as language and art) for self-expression and the exchange of ideas, and for organizing themselves into purposeful groups. Humans create complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values,9 social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena (or events) has provided the foundation for developing science, philosophy, mythology, religion, anthropology, and numerous other fields of knowledge., Though most of human existence has been sustained by hunting and gathering in band societies,10 increasing numbers of human societies began to practice sedentary agriculture approximately some 10,000 years ago,11 domesticating plants and animals, thus allowing for the growth of civilization. These human societies subsequently expanded in size, establishing various forms of government, religion, and culture around the world, unifying people within regions to form states and empires. The rapid advancement of scientific and medical understanding in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the development of fuel-driven technologies and increased lifespans, causing the human population to rise exponentially. Today the global human population is estimated by the United Nations to be near 7.6\\xa0billion.12\n",

Jackson, Christopher Lee, Temuera Morrison, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker und Frank Oz Jahre nach den Ereignissen in The Phantom Menace steht die Galaxie am Rande eines Bürgerkriegs. Unter der Führung eines ehemaligen Jedi namens Graf Dooku drohen Tausende von Planetensystemen aus der Galaktischen Republik auszutreten. Nachdem Senator Padmé Amidala dem Attentat entgangen ist, entführt der Jedi-Lehrling Anakin Skywalker wird ihr Beschützer, während sein Mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi den Versuch auf Padmés Leben untersucht. Bald erleben Anakin, Padmé und Obi-Wan den Beginn einer neuen Bedrohung für die Galaxie, die Klonkriege. \", Entwicklung des Angriffs der Klone begann im März 2000 nach der Veröffentlichung von The Phantom Menace. Bis Juni 2000 haben Lucas und Hales einen Entwurf des Drehbuchs fertiggestellt, und von Juni bis September 2000 fand die Hauptfotografie statt. Das Filmteam drehte hauptsächlich in den Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, Australien, mit zusätzlichem Filmmaterial, das in Tunesien, Spanien und Italien gedreht wurde.

He is depicted as a large, slug-like2 alien. His appearance has been described by film critic Roger Ebert as a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat.3, \"In the original theatrical releases of the original Star Wars trilogy, Jabba the Hutt first appeared in Return of the Jedi (1983), though he is mentioned in Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and a previously deleted scene involving Jabba the Hutt was added to the 1997 theatrical re-release and subsequent home media releases of Star Wars. Jabba is introduced as the de facto leader of the Desilijic-Hutt Cartel, and the most powerful crime boss on Tatooine, who has a bounty on Han Solos head. Jabba employs a retinue of career criminals, bounty hunters, smugglers, assassins and bodyguards to operate his criminal empire. He keeps a host of entertainers at his disposal at his palace: slaves, droids and alien creatures. Jabba has a grim sense of humor, an insatiable appetite, and affinities for gambling, slave girls, and torture.1\", \"The character was incorporated into the Star Wars merchandising campaign that corresponded with the theatrical release of Return of the Jedi. Besides the films, Jabba the Hutt is featured in Star Wars Legends literature. Jabba the Hutts image has since played an influential role in popular culture, particularly in the United States. The name is used as a satirical literary device and a political caricature to underscore negative qualities such as morbid obesity and corruption.45\"\n",

In Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, it was the site of a blockade by the Trade Federation and the Battle of Naboo between the Federation and the native inhabitants. Naboo is seen in four films in the Star Wars series, having a prominent role in the first two prequels and glimpsed briefly in Revenge of the Sith and the 2004 DVD release of Return of the Jedi., \"Theeds architecture, while referencing Ancient Rome and other classical traditions, was heavily inspired by the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Marin County Civic Center in California.

Phasma est apparu en bonne place dans la promotion et le marketing de The Force Awakens, mais le rôle finalement mineur des personnages dans le film a fait l'objet de critiques.

Die Figur erschien auch zusätzlich in Before the Awakening, einem Anthologiebuch, das vor den Ereignissen von The Force Awakens spielt. \", \"J. J. Abrams schuf Phasma aus einem ursprünglich für Kylo Ren entwickelten Rüstungsdesign und benannte sie nach dem Horrorfilm Phantasm von 1979. Die Figur wurde ursprünglich als männlich konzipiert, bevor sie in weiblich geändert wurde. Phasma spielte eine herausragende Rolle in der Werbung und im Marketing für The Force Awakens, aber die letztendlich untergeordnete Rolle der Charaktere im Film wurde kritisiert. Nichtsdestotrotz fanden Waren mit der Figur Erfolg und ihre Figur war der Bestseller aller Force Awakens-Actionfiguren auf Amazon.co.uk.3\"\n",

It is the first film in the original Star Wars trilogy, the first Star Wars movie in general, and the beginning of the Star Wars franchise. Starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew, the films plot focuses on the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empires space station, the Death Star. This conflict disrupts the isolated life of farmhand Luke Skywalker (Hamill), who inadvertently acquires a pair of droids that possess stolen architectural plans for the Death Star. When the Empire begins a destructive search for the missing droids, Skywalker accompanies Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Guinness) on a mission to return the plans to the Rebel Alliance and rescue Leia from her imprisonment by the Empire.\", Star Wars was released in theatres in the United States on May 25, 1977. It earned $461 million in the U.S. and $314 million overseas, totaling $775 million ($3.132 billion in 2017 dollars, adjusted for inflation). It surpassed Jaws (1975) to become the highest-grossing film of all time until the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). When adjusted for inflation, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film in North America, and the third-highest-grossing film in the world. It received ten Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture), winning seven. It was among the first films to be selected as part of the U.S. Library of Congress\\ National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". At the time, it was the most recent film on the registry and the only one chosen from the 1970s. Its soundtrack was added to the U.S. National Recording Registry in 2004. Today, it is often regarded as one of the most important films in the history of motion pictures. It launched an industry of tie-in products, including TV series spinoffs, novels, comic books, and video games, and merchandise including toys, games and clothing., \"The films success led to two critically and commercially successful sequels, The Empire Strikes Back in 1980 and Return of the Jedi in 1983. Star Wars was reissued multiple times at Lucas behest, incorporating many changes including modified computer-generated effects, altered dialogue, re-edited shots, remixed soundtracks, and added scenes. A prequel trilogy was released beginning with The Phantom Menace in 1999, continuing with Attack of the Clones in 2002, and concluding with Revenge of the Sith in 2005. The film was followed by a sequel trilogy beginning with The Force Awakens in 2015. A direct prequel, Rogue One, was released in 2016. The films fourth sequel, The Last Jedi, will be released in December 2017.\"\n",

It is the tropical, forested home world of the Wookiees. According to interviews given by Star Wars creator George Lucas, the home of the Wookiees was originally intended to be the forest moon of Endor which plays a key role in the plot of the sixth film of the series, Return of the Jedi.1 However, Lucas decided that since the Wookiee Chewbacca was clearly proficient with advanced technology (i.e. he was pilot and mechanic of the spaceship the Millennium Falcon and he repaired the damaged droid C-3PO), it would be confusing to show the Wookiees with a primitive, \"stone age\" culture on Endor. The Ewoks were created instead to populate the moon and to help fight the Imperial garrison stationed there.2 Kashyyyk made appearances in the Star Wars Holiday Special and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith.\n",
      "https://swapi.co/resource/vehicle/53 -> https://swapi.co/vocabulary/altDesc -> Walkers are vehicles from the Star Wars universe that traverse the landscape on mechanical legs. They are used by the Old Republic and the Galactic Empire for ground assault or transport. Throughout the saga, walkers have played a pivotal role in the fate of characters and the outcome of battles. Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) is responsible for their animation and design, often using models, stop-motion animation, and relevant matte paintings to depict their presence in the films., There are a variety of walkers: The Empire Strikes Back introduces the All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT) and All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST). Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith introduced earlier models of walkers, such as the AT-TE, and the Star Wars expanded universe features numerous others. Walker variants have been merchandised and featured in popular culture.\n",

      "https://swapi.co/resource/human/4 -> https://swapi.co/vocabulary/desc -> Darth Vader, also known by his birth name Anakin Skywalker, is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise.123 Vader appears in the original film trilogy as a pivotal antagonist whose actions drive the plot, while his past as Anakin Skywalker and the story of his corruption are central to the narrative of the prequel trilogy., The character was created by George Lucas and has been portrayed by numerous actors. His appearances span the first six Star Wars films, as well as Rogue One, and his character is heavily referenced in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. He is also an important character in the Star Wars expanded universe of television series, video games, novels, literature and comic books. Originally a Jedi prophesied to bring balance to the Force, he falls to the dark side of the Force and serves the evil Galactic Empire at the right hand of his Sith master, Emperor Palpatine (also known as Darth Sidious).4 He is also the father of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa, secret husband of Padmé Amidala and grandfather of Kylo Ren., Darth Vader has become one of the most iconic villains in popular culture, and has been listed among the greatest villains and fictional characters ever.56 The American Film Institute listed him as the third greatest movie villain in cinema history on 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, behind Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates.7 However, other critics consider him a tragic hero, citing his original motivations for the greater good before his fall to the dark side.89\n",

Während der gesamten Saga haben Wanderer eine entscheidende Rolle im Schicksal der Charaktere und im Ergebnis von Schlachten gespielt. Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) ist für ihre Animation und ihr Design verantwortlich. Oft werden Modelle, Stop-Motion-Animationen und relevante matte Gemälde verwendet, um ihre Präsenz in den Filmen darzustellen. Es gibt eine Vielzahl von Wanderern: The Empire Strikes Back stellt das vor All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT) und All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST). Star Wars: Episode II - Angriff der Klone und Star Wars: Episode III - Die Rache der Sith führte frühere Modelle von Wanderern wie den AT-TE ein, und das erweiterte Star Wars-Universum bietet zahlreiche weitere.

It first appeared in the 1977 film Star Wars and is depicted as a large red gas giant with an extensive satellite system of moons. Within the Star Wars narrative, Yavin is noted as the hidden military base of the Rebel Alliance located on its fourth moon, known as Yavin\\xa0IV., The climactic space battle at the end of the film, in which the Rebel Alliance destroys the Death Star, takes place in orbit around the planet Yavin. In Star Wars fandom and the Star Wars expanded universe, this event is especially significant as it is used to mark an epoch in the fictional Star Wars universe.

      "https://swapi.co/resource/film/7 -> https://swapi.co/vocabulary/desc -> \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens (also known as Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens) is a 2015 American epic space opera film co-written, co-produced and directed by J. J. Abrams. The sequel to 1983s Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens is the first installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. It stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyongo, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max von Sydow. Produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and Abrams production company Bad Robot Productions and distributed worldwide by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, The Force Awakens was the first Star Wars film not produced by franchise creator George Lucas. Set 30 years after Return of the Jedi, it follows Rey, Finn and Poe Damerons search for Luke Skywalker and their fight alongside the Resistance, led by veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor to the Galactic Empire.\", \"The Force Awakens was announced after The Walt Disney Companys acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. It was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous six films, returned to compose the films score. Lucas served as creative consultant during the films early production. Filming began in April 2014 in Abu Dhabi and Iceland, with principal photography also taking place in Ireland and Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom, and concluded in November 2014. It is the first live-action Star Wars film since Revenge of the Sith (2005).\", Star Wars: The Force Awakens was widely anticipated, and Disney backed the film with extensive marketing campaigns. It premiered in Los Angeles on December 14, 2015, four days before its wide release. The film received positive reviews, with its ensemble cast, direction, musical score, visual effects, and action sequences receiving particular praise, though it received some criticism for being derivative of the original trilogy. The film broke various box office records and became, unadjusted for inflation, the highest-grossing installment in the franchise, the highest-grossing film in North America, and the third-highest-grossing film of all time, with a worldwide gross of over $2 billion and a net profit of over $780 million.67 It received five Academy Award nominations and four British Academy Film Award nominations, where it won Best Special Visual Effects. Two sequels, The Last Jedi and Episode IX, are scheduled for release in 2017 and 2019, respectively.\n",

The starship, or a similar one, also has a cameo in Revenge of the Sith (2005). Additionally, the Falcon appears in a variety of Star Wars expanded universe materials, including books, comics, and games; James Luceno\\'s novel Millennium Falcon focuses on the titular ship. It also appears in the 2014 animated film The Lego Movie in Lego form, with Billy Dee Williams and Anthony Daniels reprising their roles of Lando Calrissian and C-3PO, and Keith Ferguson voicing Han Solo.\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story depicts the YT-1300 Corellian light freighter being embodied by L3-37 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). The ship is primarily commanded by smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford and Alden Ehrenreich) and his Wookiee first mate, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew and Joonas Suotamo), and was previously owned by gambler con-artist Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams and Donald Glover). Described as being one of the fastest vessels in the Star Wars canon, the Falcon looks like a worn-out junker, but despite its humble origins and shabby exterior, the Millennium Falcon has played a critical role in some of the greatest victories of the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic.\\n\\n\\n== Origin and design ==\\nThe ship originally had a more elongated appearance, but this design\\'s similarity to the Eagle Transporters in Space: 1999 prompted Lucas to change the Falcon\\'s design. The original model was modified, re-scaled, and used as Princess Leia\\'s ship, Tantive IV. Modelmaker Joe Johnston had about four weeks to redesign the Falcon, and Lucas\\' only suggestion to Johnston was to \"think of a flying saucer\". Johnston did not want to produce a \"basic flying saucer\", so he created the offset cockpit, forward cargo mandibles, and rear slot for the engines. It was also said that the shape of the ship was roughly based on a hamburger with an olive-on-the-side cockpit. The design was simple enough to create in the four-week window. Johnston called production of the new Falcon design one of his most intense projects.The sound of the ship traveling through hyperspace comes from two tracks of the engine noise of a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, with one track slightly out of synchronization with the other to introduce a phasing effect. To this, sound designer Ben Burtt added the hum of the cooling fans on the motion-control rig at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM).\\n\\n\\n=== Models and sets ===\\n\\nVisually, the Millennium Falcon was represented by several models and external and internal sets. For Star Wars, a partial exterior set was constructed and the set dressed as Mos Eisley\\'s Docking Bay 94 and the Death Star hangar. Besides the functional landing gear, an additional support held up the structure and was disguised as a fuel line. The interior set included the starboard ring corridor, the boarding ramp, cockpit access tunnel, gun turret ladder, secret compartments, and the forward hold. The cockpit was constructed as a separate set that could be rocked when the ship was supposed to shake. Several inconsistencies exist between the internal set and the external set, the cockpit access tunnel angle being the most noticeable.\\nThe effects models for Star Wars matched the design of the exterior set. The primary model was five feet long and detailed with various kit parts. The ship was represented by a matte painting when Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) sees it for the first time, showing the full upper surface. For the 1997 \"Special Edition\", a digital model replaces the effects model in several shots, and is used in a new shot of the Falcon lifting off from Docking Bay 94.For The Empire Strikes Back, a new external set was constructed. In spring 1979, Marcon Fabrications, a heavy engineering firm that served the UK\\'s petrochemical and oil industries, was hired to build a movable full-scale external model capable of \"moving as if it were about to take off.\" Built in secrecy under the project code name Magic Roundabout, the company leased the 1930s Western Sunderland Flying Boat hangar in Pembroke Dock, West Wales. The model, which took three months to construct, weighed over 25 long tons (25 t), measured 65 feet (20 m) in diameter and 20 feet (6.1 m) high, and used compressed air hover pads for up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) of hover-height movement around the set. It was then disassembled and shipped to Elstree Studios, Hertfordshire, for filming. Today, the Pembroke Dock museum has an exhibit about the project.Along with the full-size mock-up of the Falcon, a new miniature model was created for Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back to allow ILM to film more intricate in-flight rolls and pitches that were not possible with the five-foot model. This model was able to be mounted on a gimbal that allowed ILM to simulate very difficult maneuvers as the ship attempted to outrun Imperial TIE fighters during the asteroid-field-escape scene from the film. The new model, which measured at approximately 32 inches in length, had several surface features that differed from the five-foot model including updated landing gear and different surface greebles. The 32\" model was the version of the Millennium Falcon most depicted in toys, model kits, and promotional materials for the Star Wars universe prior to the release of The Force Awakens. The model was reused for Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi. At the end of this production, the model was destroyed.As in Star Wars, the location set was changed around the ship set. The only major design change was to add landing gear where the disguised fuel line had been in Star Wars. As this set included the port side, that gave the set seven landing gears. The internal set was slightly refitted from A New Hope and featured a sliding cockpit door, a larger cargo hold, an additional corridor to port, and an equipment room. The cockpit was rebuilt slightly larger to allow more actors to fit comfortably; shots were apparently slightly cropped in later releases of the film to hide this alteration. Two new interior sets were created that are not shown to connect to the rest of the set: a top hatch that Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) uses to rescue Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and the compartment where Luke rests on a bunk.\\nThe 5-foot-long (1.5 m) effects model from Star Wars was modified to reflect the additional landing gear, and several new models were built, including one roughly the size of a U.S. Quarter Dollar. For the 1997 Special Edition, a CGI model replaced the effects model during the approach and landing on Cloud City.\\nNo new models or sets were created for Return of the Jedi. A portion of the full-scale ship was used for a scene cut from the film in which several characters board the Falcon in a sandstorm on Tatooine. In the scene when Han exacts a promise from Lando not to damage the Falcon, the Falcon is represented by a backdrop painting. It is also in a matte painting of the entire hangar bay.\\nThe internal and external sets were scrapped after filming on Return of the Jedi ended. The effects models were kept by Lucasfilm and some have been on display from time to time.\\nA digital version of the Falcon appears briefly on Coruscant in Revenge of the Sith (2005). Lucas has confirmed that the ship is the Falcon and not another ship of similar design. A CGI version of the vessel also appears in the Disney attraction Star Tours: The Adventures Continue.\\nOn June 3, 2014, TMZ confirmed that the Falcon would return for Star Wars: The Force Awakens when it leaked a photo from the set of the film, showing a full-scale version of the Falcon being built. An effects shot of the Falcon appears in the teaser trailer for The Force Awakens, released on November 28, 2014. This version of the ship is a digital recreation of the original 1977 five-foot model, with additional detailing reflecting the passage of time. The most noticeable change is the rectangular sensor array above the top hull, which replaces the circular dish from the first three films. \\n\\n\\n== Depiction ==\\n“You came in that thing? You’re braver than I thought.”\\nHan Solo won the Millennium Falcon from Lando Calrissian in the card game \\'sabacc\\' several years before the events of the film A New Hope. In Star Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and Luke Skywalker\\n(Mark Hamill) charter the ship in the Mos Eisley cantina to deliver them, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), and the stolen Death Star plans to Alderaan. When the Falcon is captured by the Death Star, the group conceal themselves in smuggling compartments built into the floor to avoid detection during a search of the ship. Solo later collects his fee for delivering them to the hidden Rebel base and departs under bitter circumstances, but returns to assist Luke in destroying the Death Star.\\nSolo pilots the Falcon, with Chewbacca, Leia, and C-3PO aboard, to elude the Imperial Starfleet in The Empire Strikes Back, wherein they take refuge at Cloud City, where Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) captures Solo. Lando Calrissian helps the others escape and, at the film\\'s end, he departs in the Falcon to track down Solo and his captor, Jabba the Hutt. Calrissian again captains the Falcon during the climax of Return of the Jedi, with Nien Nunb as co-pilot, to destroy the second Death Star. Before the second Death Star is destroyed, Lando accidentally damages the ship by hitting the circular sensor rectenna dish on a random pipe or circuit in the second Death Star. Lando and the others still have success in destroying the Galactic Empire.\\nIn Star Wars: The Force Awakens, set some 30 years after Return of the Jedi, the Falcon is in the possession of a scrap dealer named Unkar Plutt on the desert planet Jakku, having been stolen from Solo and Chewbacca some years prior. Scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) and former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) steal the Falcon in order to escape from an attack by the First Order, having been targeted for having the droid BB-8 in their possession. They are captured by a smuggling freighter, which turns out to be piloted by Solo and Chewbacca, who reclaim the Falcon. Forced to escape in the Falcon from an ambush by parties to whom Solo is heavily in debt, Solo reluctantly agrees to help Rey and Finn return BB-8 to the Resistance. After Rey is captured by the First Order, Solo agrees to take Finn in the Falcon to the First Order\\'s new Starkiller Base—a planet that has been converted into the next generation of \\'Death Star\\'—by attempting a risky maneuver of bypassing the planet\\'s defences by exiting hyperspace in its atmosphere. When Solo is killed by his son, the rebels escape the destructing Starkiller Base. Later, Rey uses a newly-assembled map to travel to Ahch-To, the site of the first Jedi temple, to make contact with the long-lost Luke Skywalker, travelling in the Falcon in the company of Chewbacca and R2-D2.\\nThe Falcon appears again in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, still on Ahch-To with Rey and Chewbacca. Later in the film, Chewbacca and Rey take the Falcon to the planet Crait, where the Resistance is under attack by the First Order. The Falcon loses its sensor dish for the third time on Crait, after it is shot off by a TIE fighter, but still manages to single-handedly take out most of the First Order\\'s fighters on the planet while Luke distracts Kylo Ren. After the battle, surviving Resistance personnel leave Crait aboard the Falcon.\\nIn The Last Jedi, Rey uses the Falcon\\'s escape pod to board Supreme Leader Snoke\\'s ship. Director Rian Johnson noted that he wanted its design to resemble a coffin, inspired by C.S. Lewis\\' Perelandra. The escape pod was monogrammed to say \"Property of Han Solo\". In the film Solo: A Star Wars Story, it is revealed that Lando modified the Falcon by putting an escape pod between the frontal \\'mandibles\\', which Han jettisons to escape a gravity well.\\n\\n\\n=== Kessel Run ===\\n“Fast ship? You\\'ve never heard of the Millennium Falcon? It\\'s the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. I\\'ve outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers mind you, I\\'m talking about the big Corellian ships now... She\\'ll make point five past lightspeed. She may not look like much, but she\\'s got it where it counts, kid. I\\'ve made a lot of special modifications myself.”\\nIn the initial film, Solo brags that the Falcon \"made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs\". As the parsec is a unit of distance, not time, different explanations have been provided. In the fourth draft of the script, Kenobi \"reacts to Solo\\'s stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation.\" Lucas acknowledged the misnomer in 1977, saying that Han modified \"the navigational system to get through hyperspace in the shortest possible distance\". On the film\\'s DVD audio commentary, Lucas further explained that in the Star Wars universe, traveling through hyperspace requires careful navigation to avoid stars, planets, asteroids, and other obstacles, and that is because no long-distance journey can be made in a straight line, the \"fastest\" ship is the one that can plot the \"most direct course\", thereby traveling the least distance.In The Force Awakens, Rey references the Kessel Run but describes it as being completed in fourteen parsecs, after which Solo corrects her.\\nIn Solo: A Star Wars Story, Solo\\'s Kessel Run is depicted in detail, providing an explanation for the \"twelve parsec\" boast. Solo has to make many calculated jumps to avoid killing the crew. After integrating the memory module of Lando\\'s damaged L3 droid into the ship\\'s navigation, Solo is able to take a \"shortcut\" (which is dangerously close to a black hole). Chewbacca indicates the real distance was closer to 13 parsecs, but Solo insists, \"Not if you round down,\" implying that the claim of \"less than twelve parsecs\" is slightly exaggerated.\\n\\n\\n=== Ownership ===\\nThe Falcon has been depicted many times in the franchise, and its ownership and command have changed several times.\\n\\nPrior to Star Wars, the Falcon was in the possession of Lando Calrissian. He lost it to Han Solo in payment of a gambling debt.  This is depicted in Solo: A Star Wars Story, as well as the integration of Lando\\'s droid L3-37 with the ship\\'s computer.\\nAfter the events of The Empire Strikes Back, Leia, Chewbacca and Lando take possession of the Falcon after Solo\\'s hibernation in carbonite and capture by the Empire and Boba Fett.\\nDuring Return of the Jedi, Solo leaves Tatooine aboard the Millennium Falcon, and on arrival at the rendezvous for the Rebel fleet he lends the Falcon to Calrissian, who pilots it during the Battle of Endor and the destruction of the second Death Star.\\nAfter the events of Return of the Jedi, the Falcon is stolen from Solo, ending up on the planet Jakku under the ownership of a scrap dealer, Unkar Plutt, 30 years after the Battle of Endor. In The Force Awakens, Rey and Finn commandeer the ship to escape the planet, only to be found by Solo and Chewbacca, who immediately reclaim the ship.\\nAfter the death of Solo, Rey pilots the Falcon, with Chewbacca as her co-pilot. The novelization of The Force Awakens states that Chewbacca willingly abdicates captaincy of the Falcon to Rey.\\nAfter the events of The Last Jedi, the ship becomes the base of operations for the remaining members of the Resistance.\\nAfter the events of The Rise of Skywalker the Falcon is again piloted by Lando Calrissian with Chewbacca.\\n\\n\\n== Cultural influence ==\\nJoss Whedon credits the Millennium Falcon as one of his two primary inspirations for his Firefly television show. The Falcon and the Falcon\\'s distinct shape appear in Star Trek: First Contact, Blade Runner, Spaceballs, and Starship Troopers. The manga series Berserk includes a Millennium Falcon arc.SpaceX states that their launch vehicles (except Starship) are named after the Millennium Falcon.\\n\\n\\n=== Biology ===\\nThe middle Cambrian arthropod Cambroraster falcatus is named after the Millennium Falcon \\n\\n\\n=== Toys ===\\n\\nKenner, Hasbro, Steel Tec, Master Replicas, Code 3 Collectibles and Micro Machines have all released Millennium Falcon toys and puzzles, including a Transformers version of the ship.\\nHot Wheels has made a model of the ship for their Star Wars starship line and a version of it as a car. It is also available as a Hot Wheels playset.Lego has released multiple versions of the Millennium Falcon in varying sizes. The 5,195-piece Lego model (part of the Star Wars \"Ultimate Collectors Series\") was physically the largest Lego set sold by the company, until it was topped in 2008 by the Lego Taj Mahal. In September 2017, Lego released an updated Millennium Falcon set in the Star Wars \"Ultimate Collectors Series\".  With the new interior and more details compared to the 2007 model, the 7,541-piece model is the largest and most expensive commercially available Lego set. Lego has also made a version of the Falcon to tie in with the Star Wars film, Solo. It is called the Kessel Run Millennium Falcon.\\n\\n\\n== Theme park attractions ==\\n\\nOn May 31, 2019, a full sized replica of the Falcon was opened to the public along with the rest of Star Wars: Galaxy\\'s Edge at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, along with a flight simulator attraction,  Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run, in which riders take control of the Falcon from inside the iconic cockpit. An identical version of the attraction opened on August 29, 2019, at Disney\\'s Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida.\\nA third incarnation of the attraction has been announced for Walt Disney Studios Park at the Disneyland Paris Resort in Marne-la-Vallée, France.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of Star Wars spacecraft\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nFootnotes\\n\\nCitations\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nMillennium Falcon in the StarWars.com Databank\\nStar Wars\\'s channel on YouTube — Making of the Millennium Falcon, Millennium Falcon and Asteroids, Tour The Millennium Falcon with Donald Glover\\nILMVFX\\'s channel on YouTube - Creating Lando\\'s Millennium Falcon for Solo: A Star Wars Story, Behind the Magic of the Kessel Run\\nMillennium Falcon on Wookieepedia, a Star Wars wiki\\nMillennium Falcon Notes: information for model builders\\nHow Fast is the Millennium Falcon?: a thought experiment'"
